time carries on

longpoll clean up - early run seems to have fucked something up (deleting a
longpoll that was too young or the re-request was never sent, or hung .. but
there was an lp in progress (updates came back when a new table was created))
fuck knows

seating - standing just switches to SPC, ready still on (and sitting back
down re takes same seat)

direct challenge sb stays on tab switch

time - user's time looks less than it appears to the opponent - error
increases as game goes on.  increment?

apostrophes in table chat are coming back with visible backslashes

abort game if no start - use a tornado timer

xhr - specify whether to restart if not going

mem tbls limit

xhr check - not on update (no way of diff. betweenn hanging problem and
legit long polling)

users tab reload - should probably be auto, and stop when the challenge
dialog is open.  or not stop.  users online probs doesn't change very often an

tables - need to delete if anyone leaves, not just seated (currently deletes
if spec closes app tab but not if closes browser)

hanging - intermittent, any page, never gets to apache, about 1 in 30 or
40 requests hangs forever (ended by chrome timeout after about 15 min).
seems to be a problem with chrome, possibly adblock.
